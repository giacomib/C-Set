# C-Set

## Description
A university project made in C++, implements the class Set, which is a set of non duplicated elements added by the users.

## Setup
To compile and run the main you have to download "Main Project" folder, then you have to use the command "make" from the command line
to execute the makefile.
Notes:
- You have to be in the same folder of "Main Project" when executing "make" command.
- "make" is a GNU command, so, in order to be able to use it, you need to have installed a version of the make command itself. (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows)  

Main.cpp: this file is used to test some of the functionality of the Set on both standard types and custom types.
